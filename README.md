# 💒 Wedding Celebration Website

This is a beautiful and simple wedding website made with love — with the help of AI! 🌸  
It’s made to showcase two wedding invitations in one place, and it's fully ready to open and enjoy in a browser.

## 🏠 What's Inside

This website has one main page and two wedding pages:

- `index.html` — This is the **main page**. It shows two beautiful cards, each representing a couple. You click on a card to visit their personal wedding page.
- `b&r.html` — The wedding page for the first couple (**Barnali & Rajib**).
- `j&p.html` — The wedding page for the second couple (**Joydip & Puja**).
- `styles.css` — This is the **styling file** that makes everything look pretty with colors, fonts, borders, animations, and more.

Everything is connected and works right out of the box — no setup or installation needed.

## 📸 How to Use

1. **Download the files** (if not already).
2. **Double-click** on `index.html` — it will open in your browser.
3. Click on either couple’s card to visit their special page.
4. That’s it! 💕

## 🌐 No Hosting? No Problem!

You can share the folder with anyone — they can also open `index.html` on their own computer and view everything.

Or, if you want to show it online, you can upload it to GitHub and use **GitHub Pages** (just ask or search “how to publish HTML on GitHub Pages” — it’s free!).
